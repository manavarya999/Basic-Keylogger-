# What is a keylogger?
A keylogger (short for keystroke logger) is a software that tracks or logs the keys struck on your keyboard, typically in a covert manner so that you don’t know that your actions are being monitored. This is usually done with malicious intent to collect your account information, credit card numbers, user names, passwords, and other private data.

Legitimate uses do exist for keyloggers. Parents can monitor their children’s online activity or law enforcement may use it to analyze and track incidents linked to the use of personal computers, and employers can make sure their employees are working instead of surfing the web all day.


# How to run it?

1) Download the repo. 
2) Navigate to the downloaded folder. 
3) Open "send_mail.py" and make changes (put your email id in the required fields).
4) Open command prompt/terminal and navigate to the keylogger directory that you have downloaded.
5) Type "python keyl0gger.py" and the program will start capturing the keystrokes and will be send to the provided email id.

# What if it's not working?

If the keystrokes are not being sent to your provided email id then make sure to turn on the "allow less secure apps" (maybe different for other than google accounts) settings in your account.

It is suggested to set up a dummy account for testing purpose.
